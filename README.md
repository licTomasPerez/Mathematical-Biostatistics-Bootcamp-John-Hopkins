# Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp John-Hopkins

In this repository you'll find my solutions and lecture notes for the four-course Mathematical Biostatistics Bootcamp offered by John Hopkins University's 
Howework and Quizzes assignements, written in TeX and compiled using Overleaf's online LaTex editor, as well as the implemented R & Python source code to solve said exercises. 

## Numerical Calculations

Many exercises include both an analytical and numerical solution, with said numerical solutions written in R and Python. In particular, the Python routines were written using the Numpy, Math and SymPy libraries within the Jupyter Notebook and RStudio platforms installed via de Conda extension.
